# ksaucelabs-tools

Tools used for tests running on Saucelabs.

In particular, we host here the prerun-executables, as they have to be available on the internet somewhere

NB: to retrieve logs of prerun scripts, the url to use is of the form:

    https://assets.saucelabs.com/jobs/3c3ddaf2d00b48d78844eb7f6aa456c3/prerun.log

Take notice that only stdout of the script is logged there, not stderr.
